               this is the incredible documentation of the new

                             TFMX-PLAYER V3.21

               read it carefully to understand all functions !

Copyright:      This program was written by 'The Swing' in June/July 1992
                TFMX-Player is FREEWARE, which means that you can copy it
                and use it but you aren't allowed to change anything !!!!

                The name TFMX (The Final Musicsystem eXtended),
                the 4 & 8 Voice-Routines were written & (C) by
                J.Hippel/C.Huelsbeck.

                Bitty-Soft-Industries (BSI) optimized the 4V-Routine,
                so there must go a lot of thanx to him.

                Some major optimizing on the 8V-Routine were done
                by myself. We (SWING/BSI) still work on it.

The tale of a dissatisfied Computer-Music-Lover:

                Once upon a time there was a game called Turrican 2.
                A young Amiga-User played (and solved) this perfect
                game and enjoyed the great sound. 'I must get this
                music', he said and started to work.

                'Hmmmm.',he thought,'The musician is the Master Of Music:
                Chris Huelsbeck.....it must be a masterpiece of TFMX'

                What an awful tale, lets speeeeeeeeeed up a bit.

                As an owner of the original TFMX-Editor I am able to
                rip any kind of TFMX-Module (because I know the
                structure of them).

                After I ripped so many songs (Turrican I,II Apidya,
                Z-Out, X-Out, MonkeyIsland, Masterblazer, Hard&Heavy,
                Battle Isle, MUDS, etc.) I needed a program to play
                them. I found the great MultiPlayer but this program
                played (at this time) only the very old modules.

                My original TFMX-Editor has got the same problem.
                So I started to rip the play-routines.

                With these new routines I was able to play ALL
                modules.

                The aim was set - I NEED MY OWN PLAYER !!!!!!!

*****************************************************************************

What you should know about TFMX-Modules:

                These modules are built in an different way as you know
                it from the Noise/Pro or anthing-else-Tracker

                A TFMX-Module has got two files.
                There is a musicdata file (mostly started with mdat.Filename)
                And there is a sampledata file (smpl.Filename).

                You need BOTH files to play a song !
                
*****************************************************************************

What you need to use TFMX-Player V3.21:

                an Amiga 500(+)/600(HD)/1000/2000/2500/3000/4000........
                that means it will work on EVERY Amiga.

                Yo, it's time to use Kickstart 2.04
                you need it (or higher versions)

                you need the asl.library in your LIBS: dir

                and of course some modules to play....

                If you have only Kick 1.2/1.3 look out for
                TFMX-Player V2.3

*****************************************************************************

HOW TO START:
                from CLI (who's using that ?) or Shell:

                        enter TFMX-Player (you don't need to run it)

                from Workbench:

                        double-click on its icon

*****************************************************************************

HOW TO USE:
                After starting you will see a wonderful window.
                If not, and no errormessage was displayed, you
                should reboot (can't open ROMLibs/not enought memory).

                You can divide the window in 3 parts.

                the first part is the GADGETCONTROL-part.
                From this part you can control all actions.

                the second part is the INFOBLOCK (box below)
                here you can see some informations about the current song

                last but not least there is the PLAYCONTROL (right box)
                there are a lot of LEDs there......

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

GADGET-CONTROL:
                All Gadgets (except the cyclegadgets) can be controlled
                by the keyboard.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gadgetname      Key     Function
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loadtype        ---     here you can choose the data type you want to load

                        Load mdat.& smpl. files:
                        you must load a mdat. file (the smpl. file will
                        be loaded automatically)

                        Load only mdat / Load only smpl:
                        you're able to load data in seperate ways.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Playtype        ---     on which way do you want to play ?

                        Normal Song:
                        you can play 32 different songs (NO 8V Modules)

                        Play Effect:
                        you can play 64 effects & 32 songs (NO 8V Mods)
                        Not all Modules support this.

                        Play 8 Voice:
                        here it's possible to play 8V Modules like
                        Turrican II Titlesong.
                        ATTENTION: This will slow down the system if you
                                   have only a 68000 CPU.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Load            l       a filerequester will appear and you can choose
                        a file. Take a look at the titlebar or at the
                        loadtypegadget to realize what shit you'll load.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sleep           e       shut down the window
                        to wake up you can press 'e' again or use the

INFOBLOCK (this is the 3D-Box below)

                Songnumber:     here you can see the current songnumber
                                (0-32 in Normal & 8Voice Mode)
                                (0-92 in Special Mode)

                Musicmemory:    Memoryusage of the mdat. file (Bytes)
                Samplememory:   Memoryusage of the smpl. file (Bytes)
                        
                The names of the loaded files are displayed, too.
                If they are mdat. & smpl. files you'll see the names cut.

                Example: you loaded the files: mdat.Test smpl.Test
                         .Test & .Test will be displayed



PLAYCONTROLBLOCK (this is the box at the right)

                You see some LEDs which will be active or inactive.

                Song-Type:
                Effect will be setted when current song is an effect (0-64)
                Otherwise song will be active

                Play-Type:
                Here you can see in which way you play the current song

                Playing:
                Hope you know what it'll displays (useful when any song
                or effect stops)

                Time: (& clock below)
                you must be a KNARF (the greatest piece of shit ever made)
                if you don't understand this.

BUGS/WARNINGS:

                Clock   - sometimes (while using other interrupts)
                          the clock will crash.
                        - use the Timergadget to solve problems

                The JPClock-Syndrom
                        - if you go sleeping while using JPClock
                          you wonder (me too) why my window
                          will be refreshed every second.
                        - remove JPClock

                The BEEP
                        - your system can crash when using a program
                          which uses some sounds like the beep.
                        - press 'stop' while using them.
